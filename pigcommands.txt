Create a sample dataset and implement the below Pig commands on the same dataset:-

1)Concat:It is used to concatenate two or more expressions of the same type.

2)Tokenize:It is used to split a string in a single tuple and returns a bag which contains the output of the split operation.

3)Sum:It is used to get the total of the numeric values of a column in a single-column bag. 
While computing it ignores the NULL values.

4)Max:It is used to calculate the maximum value for a column in a single-column bag. 
While calculating the maximum value it ignores the NULL values.

5)Min:It is used to calculate the minimum value for a column in a single-column bag. 
While calculating the minimum value it ignores the NULL values.

6)Limit:It is used to get the limited number of tuples from the relation.

7)Store:It is used to store the loaded data in the file system.

8)Distinct:It is used to remove duplicate tuples from a relation.

9)Flatten:It un-nests tuples as well as bags. 

10)IsEmpty:It is used to check whether the bag or map is empty or not.
